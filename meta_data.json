    "description": "This plugin overwrites the time zone for a given Bubble date with the desired time zone. For example, if you specify a time in the date picker such as July 10, 2020 5pm and you want that time to be based in New York but you are in San Francisco, then you supply the date and the time zone ID (\"America/New_York\" in this case). Now your date is based on the new time zone. \n\nThe user who entered the time and zone above would see July 10, 20202 2pm when rendered since it's a 3 hour difference and Bubble always shows time in the user's local time zone. \n\nThe plugin uses moment and moment-timezone libraries. You don't need any other elements or workflows to get the benefit you seek.\n\nIcon made by <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik\" title=\"Freepik\">Freepik</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\"> www.flaticon.com</a>",

    "plugin_instructions": "1. Drop this element on the page. You must leave the element visible for it to work. Don't worry, it won't render anything by default.\n\n2. Open the element's property inspector.\n(a) Connect the output of a date picker's value to \"localDate\" (date object). \n(b) Specify desired static time zone ID (text) in the \"dstZone\" field, or a dynamic value from a geographic Seachbox, say, using its value's time zone ID.\n\n3. The plugin outputs a new date object to \"dstDate\". This is the adjusted date with the new time zone. Since Bubble adjusts that for the browser's time zone, it will show up as the local time when rendered."
